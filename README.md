Programming projects on the ScalaNeko framework for the course CSC.T438 Distributed Algorithms taught at Tokyo Tech.

The scala code uses scala 2.13 and is based on the [ScalaNeko](https://xdefago.github.io/ScalaNeko/latest/api/neko/) framework (see some [installation guidelines](https://xdefago.github.io/ScalaNeko/)).

The directory [`rand-elec`](rand-elec/) contains a Rust program to simulate randomized leader election. Please check the relevant [README](rand-elec/README.md) file for details.
